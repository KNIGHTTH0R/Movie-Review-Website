They are also referred to as Halflings.\r\nHobbits first appeared in the novel The Hobbit, whose titular hobbit is the protagonist, Bilbo Baggins. The novel The Lord of the Rings includes more hobbits as major characters, Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, Peregrin Took and Meriadoc Brandybuck, as well as several other minor hobbit characters. Hobbits are also briefly mentioned in The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales.\r\nAccording to the author in the prologue to The Lord of the Rings, hobbits are relatives of the race of Men. Elsewhere Tolkien describes Hobbits as a variety or separate branch of humans. Within the story, hobbits and other races seem aware of the similarities (hence the colloquial terms "Big People" and "Little People" used in Bree). However, within the story, hobbits considered themselves a separate people.[4] At the time of the events in The Lord of the Rings, hobbits lived in the Shire and in Bree in the north west of Middle-earth, though by the end, some had moved out to the Tower Hills and to Gondor and Rohan.\r\n'),

The film had its world premiere on March 7, 2014 at South by Southwest and stars Chris Osborn and Samuel Davis as two brothers hunting for the legendary Sasquatch. Following the darker psychological tone of Sanchez''s previous film, Lovely Molly, the film returns to the creature-feature horror of Altered, also written by Jamie Nash. \r\nBrothers Brian and Matt, Matt''s girlfriend Dora, and their friends Todd and Elizabeth are on their way to the brothers'' uncle Bob''s cabin for a camping trip. After stopping off to buy some fireworks, they continue on their way as day turns to night. Matt hits something with the car and stops to investigate. The group hears loud cries of an animal in pain off in the distance, but decide to move onward. After coming across a tree that has been knocked across the road, the group continues on foot and reaches the cabin, only to discover that it is worn down and dilapidated. After finding a wild pig in one of the bedrooms, the group decide to spend the night in the car, where Brian and Matt again hear the loud screaming noises.\r\nThe next morning, Brian finds the front bumper on the passenger side of the car damaged; there is also some blood on the fender and a tuft of hair in the grille. Regardless, the group enjoys their day at the cabin, swimming in a nearby lake. Brian films a large, dark bipedal figure running along a nearby ridge, but nobody believes he saw anything. Determined to get the creature on film, he sets up several GoPro cameras at various points around the cabin. That night, aggressive screams are heard coming from the woods, frightening the group. One of the exterior cameras reveals a large figure approaching the cabin and ascending the stairs onto the porch. The group are further frightened when whatever is outside begins banging on the walls and doors. When silence falls, Brian goes to a window to take a look outside. He turns on the night vision on his camera, and sees a large hairy creature looking back at him before it roars and disappears from view.\r\nThe following morning, the group decides to leave. Upon reaching the car, they find it completely destroyed and quickly return to the cabin. Matt and Brian reveal that they did not tell Bob that they were using his cabin: nobody knows where the group is, and nobody will be coming to rescue them. Matt bikes out alone to an area of the woods that has cell reception so that he can call for help. Just as he gets through to Bob, he is attacked by the creatures and the camera cuts to black. Back at the cabin, the others move the furniture to block the windows and doors. They uncover a trap door to the cabin''s cellar, where Todd finds a hunting rifle and some ammo. At nightfall, a creature attacks the cabin and injures Elizabeth before Todd wounds it with the hunting rife, causing it to flee.\r\nIn the morning, it is revealed that Elizabeth has died of her injuries. The doors and windows of the cabin have been smashed wide open, meaning that the cabin can no longer offer any shelter. The remaining three members of the group decide to walk back to civilization on foot. That night, they hear Matt screaming somewhere nearby. The screams are coming from a tunnel that the group assumes to be the creature''s den. Brian goes in and rescues Matt, shooting a creature in the process. As dawn breaks, the group takes shelter in an abandoned trailer and Brian receives a call from Bob, who is now at the cabin. Todd heads out with the fireworks and sets them off in an attempt to alert Bob to their location, only to have a creature attack and kill him. The creature then pushes the trailer over the edge of a hill with Brian, Matt, and Dora inside.\r\n'),

Instead, he becomes an instructor at a driving school, while waiting for an investment opportunity to open a racing school. After he drops his daughter off to school and learns that he can no longer afford her private school tuition, he takes a fellow American as his first client. The man, Simon Keller, reveals that he has investigated Roberts'' finances and personal life. Disturbed, Roberts insists on ending the lesson and returning to the school. Keller agrees but requests that they stop at a bank first, so that he can pay Roberts.\r\nAs Keller exits the bank, he opens fire on the guards, drops a bag into the car, and demands that Roberts serve as his getaway driver. Roberts protests in disbelief and attempts to surrender to the police, who open fire on him, too. Roberts reluctantly drives off and evades the police. Keller offers to share a percentage of his loot, but the panicked Roberts insists that he is now going to end up in jail. Keller assures him that the police will not pursue them, as the bank is owned and managed by a criminal syndicate with connections to the local police. Rossi, Keller''s former associate, had previously betrayed him in the United States and then joined the Australian syndicate.\r\nRossi calls off the police and hires mercenaries to kill them. However, Agent Walker of the Australian Federal Police takes charge of the investigation over the objections of the corrupt Detective Chief Inspector Smith. Walker immediately threatens Rossi and Smith, both of whom she suspects to be part of the syndicate. Meanwhile, Keller and Roberts argue over Roberts'' disappointment in his life, which Keller states is the result of giving up on his dreams. Upset, Roberts refuses to drive any further, and Keller shoots him with a rubber bullet. The two change cars, and Roberts once again becomes the reluctant driver.\r\nAfter they evade Rossi''s assassins, the car fails, and they pull into a reception hall. The owners recognize them, and an elderly woman viciously attacks Roberts after accidentally shooting her husband. Roberts and Keller escape in the husband''s sports car and stop for gas. There, they are again recognized and attacked, though the cashier accidentally kills himself with his own shotgun. At Keller''s urging, Roberts phones the police and his wife, telling both that he has been taken hostage, though neither believe him at first. In order to heighten Roberts'' fear and make him more believable, Keller puts a gun to Roberts'' head and threatens to kill him. In response, Roberts briefly holds Keller at gunpoint with the elderly woman''s pistol, but he surrenders it when he realizes that it is empty.\r\nResigned to his fate as the getaway driver, Roberts offers to drive Keller to his final destination, a marina. On the way, the two reconcile their differences when both admit that the other has made good points about their respective lifestyles. When Roberts antagonizes a motorcycle gang, they become hostile and threaten to kill him. Keller saves his life, and, during the confrontation, the gang reveal themselves to be mercenaries in Rossi''s pay. Roberts and Keller fight them off, only to be beset by Rossi himself and more mercenaries at the marina. Meanwhile, DCI Smith confronts Agent Walker, and Walker kills Smith in self-defense.\r\nAt the marina, Roberts and Keller defeat the mercenaries, and Roberts declines a share in Keller''s stolen loot. Shot and left chained by Keller, Rossi is arrested. Keller handcuffs Roberts to the car and the two argue over whether Keller should punch him to make the situation look more believable; Roberts eventually agrees. Finding him ragged, wounded, and beaten, the police finally believe Roberts'' story, and he returns to his family, who now respect him. Though she disapproves, Roberts'' wife acquiesces to his return to professional racing.\r\n'),

The mayor signs a deal with the mega-corporationOmni Consumer Products (OCP). The corporation will run the underfunded Detroit Police Department and clean the city of crime. In exchange, OCP can turn the run-down sections of Detroit into a high-end utopia called "Delta City," which will be owned by OCP as an independent city-state free of the United States.\r\nTo combat crimes, OCP senior president Dick Jones offers the prototype ED-209 enforcement droid. In its first demonstration, ED-209 malfunctions and gruesomely kills a board member. Bob Morton, an ambitious employee, brings forth his experimental cyborg design titled "RoboCop." The OCP chairman, nicknamed "The Old Man", approves of Morton''s plan, angering Jones. Meanwhile, police officer Alex Murphy is teamed up with Anne Lewis, a rookie. On their first patrol, they chase down a gang led by the ruthless criminal Clarence Boddicker, tailing them to an abandoned steel mill. When Murphy and Lewis are separated, Boddicker''s gang kills Murphy. Morton selects Murphy for the RoboCop program. Most of his body is replaced with cybernetics, except for his brain and part of his digestive system.\r\nRoboCop is given three primary directives: Serve the public trust, Protect the innocent, and Uphold the law, as well as a fourth classified directive that Morton does not know of. He single-handedly and efficiently cleans Detroit of crime. For his success, Morton is promoted to vice-president to Jones'' anger. Jones orders Boddicker to go to Morton''s home and kill him. Meanwhile, Lewis eventually realizes that RoboCop is really Murphy, and tells him his real name. RoboCop remembers past events from his life and returns to his former home, but his wife and son have moved away. He connects to the police database, looks up Murphy''s entry and discovers Boddicker''s gang, who was responsible for his death.\r\nRoboCop tracks down Boddicker to a cocaine factory and after a battle, threatens to kill him. Panicked, Boddicker admits his affiliation with Jones, and verbally triggers RoboCop''s law-abiding programming. RoboCop arrests Boddicker. He then confronts Jones and attempts to arrest him, but begins to shut down. Jones reveals he planted the hidden Directive 4, which prevents RoboCop from arresting an OCP executive. Jones explains his larger goal of taking over OCP, and confesses to Morton''s murder. He then unleashes his personal ED-209. As RoboCop evades ED-209''s assault, he is cornered by police officers whom Jones called in. Lewis helps RoboCop escape and takes him to the steel mill. As RoboCop repairs himself, he discusses with Lewis about his former life.\r\nUnder pressure by OCP and fearing their replacement by RoboCop, the police goes on strike and crime runs rampant. Jones frees Boddicker and supplies his gang with anti-tank rifles and a tracking device to hunt down RoboCop. The gang converge on the steel mill, and are killed one by one. A gang member drops metal beams on RoboCop with an electromagnet, and Lewis kills him with an anti-tank rifle. Boddicker attacks the trapped RoboCop, but RoboCop uses his data spike to kill him.\r\nRoboCop heads back to the OCP headquarters. In the board room, Jones is proposing his ED-209 to replace the police. RoboCop enters and shows the recording of Jones'' confession in his memory. Jones'' role in Morton''s murder as well as his ambitions are revealed to the whole board. RoboCop then says he is unable to act because of his fourth directive. Jones takes the Old Man hostage and demands a helicopter. The Old Man fires Jones from OCP, nullifying the effect of Directive 4. RoboCop shoots Jones out of the tower window and leaves. The Old Man thanks him and asks for his name, to which he replies, "Murphy."\r\n'),
(7, 'Life Of Pi', '"dummy/thumb-7.jpg"', 'Adventure', 'Hollywood', ' Ang Lee', 'In Canada, novelist Yann Martel meets Pi Patel, an Indian immigrant with some knowledge from Pi''s late father''s friend, known to Pi as "Mamaji", for a good book. Pi tells Yann his life story.\r\nIn a flashback, Pi''s father named him Piscine Molitor after the swimming pool in France. By the time he reached secondary school, he changed his name to "Pi" (the Greek letter, ?) because he was tired of being called "Pissing Patel" (due to the pronunciation of his name). Pi is raised Hindu and vegetarian, but at 12 years old, he is introduced to Christianity and then Islam, and decides to follow all three religions as he "just wants to love God". His mother supports his desire to grow, but his father, a rationalist, tries to convert him to his way by understanding rather than blindly. Pi''s family owns a zoo, and Pi took great interest in the animals, especially a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. When Pi tries feeding Richard Parker through the cage bars, since his religious interests lead him to believe that animals had souls, his enraged father tells him that Richard Parker is dangerous and would kill him if he had the chance, and so his father forces Pi to witness Richard Parker killing a goat to prove his point.\r\nAt 16, Pi is still affected by the incident, causing him to be gloomy and depressed, until he meets a dancer named Anandi, with whom he develops a relationship. However, their relationship is short-lived when his father announces that they are moving to Canada, where he intends to settle and sell the zoo animals. Pi''s family books passage on a Japanese freighter named Tsimtsum. During a storm, the ship founders while Pi is on deck. He tries to find his family, but a member of the crew throws him into a lifeboat. As the ship falls into the sea, a freed zebra jumps onto the boat with him, breaking its leg as it lands. Pi watches helplessly as the ship sinks, drowning his family. After the ship disappears, Pi sees what he believes is a survivor struggling in the ocean. He calls out to the ''survivor'' who swims towards the lifeboat, however it is revealed to be Richard Parker. Pi attempts to prevent the tiger from entering the boat with an oar, however he climbs in anyway.\r\nAfter the storm, Pi finds himself in the lifeboat with the injured zebra, and is later joined by a surviving orangutan. A spotted hyena emerges from a tarpaulin covering half of the lifeboat and snaps at Pi, forcing him to retreat to the end of the boat, while it kills the zebra, and later the orangutan. Later, Richard Parker emerges from under the tarpaulin, killing the hyena and attempting to attack Pi, who distracts him by throwing a rat into his mouth. Richard Parker then retreats under the tarpaulin and does not emerge for several days.\r\nAfter many days at sea, Pi retrieves biscuits, water rations and a hand axe from the lifeboat and builds a small raft to stay at a safe distance from Richard Parker. He begins fishing and is able to feed Richard Parker. He also collects rain water for them to drink. When the tiger jumps into the sea to hunt for fish to eat, Pi considers letting him drown but ultimately helps him climb back into the boat. One night, a humpback whale breaches and lands on the rope connecting the raft to the lifeboat, completely destroying the raft. Pi loses most of his supplies, forcing him to eat fish for the first time in his life. Pi trains Richard Parker to accept him in the boat and realizes that caring for Richard Parker is keeping him alive.\r\nWeeks later they reach a floating island of edible plants, supporting a mangrove jungle, fresh water pools, and a large population of meerkats. Pi and Richard Parker eat and drink freely and regain strength. At night, the island transforms into a hostile environment: Richard Parker retreats to the lifeboat and the meerkats sleep in the trees while the fresh water pools turn acidic and digest the dead fish in the pools. Pi discovers that the island itself is carnivorous after finding a human tooth embedded in a flower. The next day, Pi and Richard Parker leave the island.\r\nSome time later, the lifeboat reaches the coast of Mexico. Pi is crushed emotionally that Richard Parker does not acknowledge him before disappearing into the jungle. Pi is rescued and brought to a hospital. Insurance agents for the Japanese company that owned the freighter interview him, but do not believe his story and ask what "really" happened. Pi tells a different story, in which he reverses the roles of the animals by replacing them with people on the Tsimtsum, with his mother being the orangutan, a BuddhistJapanese sailor being the zebra, and the ship''s cook being the Spotted Hyena, where Pi kills the cook and feeds on his flesh until he reached Mexico. The insurance agents are not satisfied with this story either, but they leave without questioning Pi any further.\r\nNext, Yann realizes the switched roles. Pi asks which story the writer prefers, and Yann chooses the first story believing it to be better, to which Pi replies "and so it goes with God". Glancing at a copy of the insurance report, Yann sees that the agents also chose to record the first story.\r\n'),

Briggs, Sam (Kevin Zegers) and Graydon (Atticus Dean Mitchell) travel to nearby Colony 5 after receiving a distress signal. Briggs leaves Sam''s lover Kai (Charlotte Sullivan) in charge of the colony while he''s gone, much to Mason''s chagrin.\r\nUpon arrival, they find Colony 5 covered in blood. They eventually reach a locked door which Sam picks open. Inside they find Leland, who shows them a message they received from another group of people who fixed a weather machine and have caused the snow to thaw. The group offers aid to anyone and asks that they bring seeds so they can be planted in the newly thawed permafrost soil. Leland shows them where the signal came from but informs them that a Colony 5 expedition failed to find the source of the transmission. Moreover, the expedition''s tracks led a marauding group of cannibals back to Colony 5 and the killing ensued. Briggs, Sam, and Graydon try to force Leland to return with them but he pushes them out and locks himself back into his room.\r\nThe three then begin to explore Colony 5 and approach a room with a fire burning.

Briggs is able to make it back to light the fuse but not before he is confronted by the cannibals. He lights the fuse and sacrifices himself while blowing up the bridge to enable Sam to return to Colony 7.\r\nKai gets into a heated argument with Mason after he kills a sick woman without testing her or giving her a choice of walking. Their argument is stopped when Kai notices a returning Sam and runs to him, but Mason promptly knocks them both out. When Sam awakens, he finds Mason has assumed control of the Colony and has plans to enforce harsh changes. Sam explains that the cannibals are en route and shares the message from Colony 5 that there is a thawed-out area they should migrate to. Mason disregards Sam''s comments as shock from his voyage and handcuffs him to a bed. Sam is able to get free and checks images from a functioning satellite to locate the thawed-out zone. He is confronted by Mason just as the cannibals have reached their Colony. Many of the Colony 7 inhabitants are killed, including Sam''s friend Viktor (John Trench). The survivors lock themselves in a room, to keep the cannibals out. Sam and Kai bang on the door, but Mason won''t let them in. Mason is knocked aside by Briggs'' daughter Nara (Lisa Berry), who lets them in. Sam comes up with a plan and Mason is left behind while the others escape.

Batman interrogates the Joker, who reveals that Rachel and Dent have been trapped in separate locations rigged with explosives. Batman races to save Rachel, while Gordon goes to save Dent. Batman arrives at the building, realizing that the Joker sent him to Dent''s location instead. Both buildings explode, killing Rachel and disfiguring half of Dent''s face. The Joker escapes the jail with Lau.\r\nColeman Reese, an accountant at Wayne Enterprises, deduces that Bruce is Batman and tries to go public with the information. The Joker sets fire to the mob''s money - burning Lau alive in the process - and kills the Chechen. He then threatens to destroy a hospital unless someone kills Reese. Gordon orders the evacuation of all the hospitals in Gotham and goes to secure Reese. The Joker finds Dent in a hospital and manipulates him into seeking revenge for Rachel''s death. He destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload of hostages. Dent goes on a killing spree, targeting people he holds responsible for Rachel''s death, including Maroni and the two cops who kidnapped Rachel.\r\nThe Joker rigs two ferries with explosives; one containing civilians and the other containing prisoners. He says that he will blow them both up by midnight, but will let one live if it blows up the other. Batman finds the Joker with a sonar device that spies on the entire city, with the reluctant help of Lucius Fox. The passengers refuse to kill each other, and Batman apprehends the Joker after a fight. As he is taken into police custody, the Joker gloats that Gotham''s citizens will lose hope once Dent''s rampage becomes public knowledge.\r\nGordon arrives at the building where Rachel died, where Dent judges his fate, along with his own and Batman''s, by flipping a coin. He spares himself, shoots Batman, and tries to kill Gordon''s son. Batman, who was wearing body armor, tackles Dent off the building to his death. Batman persuades Gordon to preserve Dent''s heroic image by holding Batman responsible for the murders. As the police launch a manhunt for Batman, Gordon destroys the Bat-signal, Fox watches as the sonar device self-destructs, and Alfred Pennyworthburns a letter from Rachel saying she is going to marry Dent.\r\n'),

Turing''s suspicious behaviour and lack of war records triggers Nock''s suspicion that he might be a Soviet spy. During his interrogation by Nock, Turing tells of his time working at Bletchley Park.\r\nWhen Britain declares war on Germany in 1939, Turing travels to Bletchley Park, where, under the direction of Commander Alastair Denniston, he joins the cryptography team ofHugh Alexander, John Cairncross, Peter Hilton, Keith Furman, and Charles Richards. The team are trying to break the ciphers created by the Enigma machine, which the Nazis use to provide security for their radio messages.\r\nTuring is difficult to work with, and considers his colleagues inferior. There is a flashback to 1927, when Turing was unhappy and bullied at boarding school. He developed a friendship with Christopher Morcom, who sparks an interest in cryptography, and eventually Turing developed romantic feelings for him. Before Turing could confess his love, Morcom died from bovine tuberculosis.\r\nTuring works alone to design a machine to decipher Enigma. After Denniston refuses to fund construction of the machine, Turing writes to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who puts Turing in charge of the team and funds the machine. Turing fires Furman and Richards and places a difficult crossword in newspapers to find replacements. Joan Clarke, a Cambridge graduate, and Jack Good pass Turing''s test, but Clarke''s parents will not allow her to work as the only female among male cryptographers. Turing arranges for her to live and work with the female clerks who intercept Enigma messages, and shares his plans with her.\r\nTuring''s machine, which he names Christopher, is constructed, but Turing cannot determine the Enigma settings fast enough before the Germans reset the encryption each day. Denniston orders it destroyed and Turing fired, but the other cryptographers threaten to leave if Turing is dismissed. After Clarke plans to leave on the wishes of her parents, Turing proposes marriage, which she accepts. During their reception, Turing confirms his homosexuality to Cairncross, who warns him to keep it secret. After overhearing a conversation with a clerk about messages she receives, Turing has an epiphany, realising he can program the machine to decode words he already knows exist in certain messages such as the word "weather" (as the morning messages always include a weather forecast) and the phrase "Heil Hitler." After he recalibrates the machine, it quickly decodes a message and the cryptographers celebrate; however, Turing realises they cannot act on every decoded message or the Germans will realise Enigma has been broken.\r\nTuring discovers that Cairncross is a Soviet spy. When Turing confronts him, Cairncross argues that the Soviets are allies working for the same goals and threatens to disclose Turing''s homosexuality if Turing talks. When MI6 agent Stewart Menzies tells Turing that Clarke has been taken into custody, Turing identifies Cairncross as the real spy. Menzies reveals that he knew this already and that he planted Cairncross among them in order to leak the information he wants the Soviets to have. Fearing for her safety, Turing tells Clarke to leave Bletchley Park, revealing that he is homosexual and lying about never having cared for her. They break up, but she remains at Bletchley. After the war, Menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work and not reveal what they have done.\r\nIn the 1950s, Turing is convicted of indecency and, given the choice of a jail sentence or chemical castration, he selects the latter so he can continue his work. Clarke visits him in his home and witnesses his physical and mental deterioration. They reconcile, as she reminds him that his work saved millions of lives.\r\nIn the end, the group is seen burning the documents, and a caption reveals Alan Turing committed suicide when he was 41 years old.\r\n'),

Working in the prison laundry, Andy is regularly assaulted by "the Sisters" and their leader, Bogs.\r\nIn 1949, Andy overhears the brutal captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance, and offers to help him legally shelter the money. After a vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats Bogs severely. Bogs is sent to another prison and Andy is never attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen. Andy''s new job is a pretext for him to begin managing financial matters for the prison employees. As time passes, the Warden begins using Andy to handle matters for a variety of people, including guards from other prisons and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters asking the state government for funds to improve the decaying library.\r\nIn 1954, Brooks is paroled, but cannot adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison, and hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in him receiving solitary confinement. After his release from solitary, Andy explains that hope is what gets him through his time, a concept that Red dismisses. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving bribes. He has Andy launder the money using the alias Randall Stephens.\r\nIn 1965, Tommy Williams is incarcerated for burglary. He is befriended by Andy and Red, and Andy helps him pass his GED exam. In 1966, Tommy reveals to Red and Andy that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for the murders for which Andy was convicted. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but he refuses to listen and sends Andy back to solitary confinement when he mentions the money laundering. Norton has Hadley murder Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue the laundering, but relents after Norton threatens to burn the library, remove Andy''s protection from the guards, and move him to worse conditions. Andy is released from solitary confinement after two months, and tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican coastal town. Red feels Andy is being unrealistic, but promises Andy that if he is ever released, he will visit a specific hayfield near Buxton, Maine, and retrieve a package Andy buried there. He worries about Andy''s wellbeing, especially when he learns Andy asked another inmate to supply him with six feet (1.8 meters) of rope.\r\nThe next day at roll call, the guards find Andy''s cell empty. The furious Norton throws a rock at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel that Andy dug with his rock hammer over the last 19 years. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, using the rope to bring with him Norton''s suit, shoes, and the ledger containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall Stephens and visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money, then mails the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.\r\nAfter serving 40 years, Red is finally paroled. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope.

She sees a glamorous woman across the room looking at a model train set display. Based on Therese''s recommendation, the woman, Carol Aird, purchases a set for her daughter as a Christmas present. Carol engages Therese in friendly conversation and when she departs accidentally leaves her gloves behind. Therese takes the gloves home and, using Frankenberg''s sales slip with Carol''s name and address, mails them to her.\r\nTherese''s boyfriend, Richard, wants her to go to France with him and hopes they will marry, but she feels ambivalent about their relationship. A mutual friend, Dannie, invites Therese to his workplace, The New York Times, offering to introduce her to a photo-editor friend. During the visit, Dannie seizes the opportunity to kiss her. Therese lets him, but becomes uncomfortable and leaves. Meanwhile, Carol is going through a difficult divorce from her neglectful husband, Harge, with whom she has a young daughter, Rindy. Carol calls the store to thank the person who returned the gloves and invites Therese to lunch. The two find themselves intrigued with one another. Carol then invites Therese to her home in New Jersey for Christmas. Carol stops to purchase a Christmas tree and Therese takes candid photos of her. Harge arrives unexpectedly to take Rindy to Florida with him and becomes suspicious of Therese because Carol had an affair years before with her best friend, Abby. Therese witnesses their argument and, after Rindy is gone, a distressed Carol takes Therese to the train station and Therese returns home.\r\nCarol later calls to apologize and the two agree to meet at Therese''s apartment, where Carol surprises her with a gift: a Canon camera and film. Carol had learned that Harge is petitioning the judge to consider a "morality clause" against her, threatening to expose her homosexuality and give him full custody of Rindy. She decides to take a road trip West to escape the stress of her divorce proceedings and invites Therese along. Richard, feeling threatened, accuses Therese of having a crush on Carol and predicts that she will soon grow tired of Therese. The two argue and their relationship comes to an end.

Not wanting the legal battle to make a mess of their child''s life, she tells Harge that he can have permanent custody of Rindy, but demands regular visitation even if supervised. Carol tells Harge that if he were to contest her offer it would get ugly and they were not "ugly people."\r\nCarol writes to Therese asking to see her, and they meet in the lounge of the Ritz Tower Hotel.

(14, 'Lagaan', '"dummy/thumb-9.jpg"', 'Drama', 'Bollywood', 'Todd Haynes', 'The story is set in the small village of Champaner (in the State of Gujarat, in western India) during the height of the British Empire in India in 1893. Captain Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne), the commanding officer of the Champaner cantonment, has imposed high taxes ("lagaan") on people from the local villages that they are unable to pay due to a prolonged drought. Led by Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), the villagers beg Raja Puran Singh (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) to help them. He tells them that, much to his regret, he is bound by British law.\r\nAfter their visit to the Raja the villagers first witness a cricket match. Bhuvan mocks the game and gets into a fight with one of the British officers. Taking an instant dislike to Bhuvan, Russell offers to cancel the taxes of the whole province "for three years" if the villagers can beat his men in a game of cricket. If the villagers lose, however, they will have to pay three times their normal taxes. Bhuvan accepts this wager on behalf of the villages in the province, without their consent. When the other villagers find out about the bet, they are furious with Bhuvan. He argues that it is important for everyone to fight against British rule.\r\nBhuvan thus begins to prepare the villagers for the match. He initially finds only five people willing to join the team. He is aided in his efforts by Russell''s sister Elizabeth (Rachel Shelley) who feels that her brother has mistreated the villagers. As she teaches them the rules of the game, she falls in love with Bhuvan, much to the anguish of Gauri (Gracy Singh) who is also in love with him. After Bhuvan reassures Gauri of his feelings for her, the woodcutter Lakha (Yashpal Sharma) becomes enraged as he is in love with Gauri.\r\nIn an attempt to discredit Bhuvan, Lakha offers himself as a spy for Russell and joins the villagers'' team to destroy it. Eventually, as the villagers realise that winning equals freedom. As a few of them are insulted by the British, they join the team. Short one player, Bhuvan invites an untouchable, Kachra (Aditya Lakhia), who can bowl spinners. The villagers, conditioned by long-term prejudice against Dalits, refuse to play if Kachra joins the team. Bhuvan chastises the villagers, shaming them into accepting Kachra.\r\nThe second half of the film focuses on the match. On the first day, Russell wins the toss and elects to bat, giving the British officers a strong start. Bhuvan brings Kachra into the match only to find that Kachra has somehow lost his ability to spin the ball new cricket balls do not spin as well as worn-down ones (which the team have been practising with). In addition, as part of his agreement with Russell, Lakha deliberately drops many catches. During the evening, however, Elizabeth sees Lakha meeting with her brother. She races to the village and informs Bhuvan of Lakha''s deception. Rather than allow the villagers to kill him, Bhuvan offers Lakha the chance to redeem himself.\r\nThe next day as part of his promise to Bhuvan, Lakha takes a diving one-handed catch. However, the British score almost 300 runs, losing only three wickets by the lunch break. Kachra is brought back to bowl and, bowling with a now-worn ball, takes a hat-trick, which sparks the collapse of the British batting side. The villagers soon start their innings. Bhuvan and Deva (a Sikh, who has played cricket earlier when he was a British sepoy) give their team a solid start. Deva misses out on his half-century when a straight drive from Bhuvan ricochets off the bowler''s hand onto the stumps at the non-striker''s end, where Deva is backing up too far. When Lakha comes on to bat, he is hit on the head by a bouncer and falls onto his stumps. Other batsmen get out trying to score a boundary off each delivery. Ismail (Raj Zutshi), a good batsman, retires hurt as he is hit on the leg. The villagers'' team ends the day with four batsmen out of action with barely a third of the required runs on board.\r\nOn the third and final day, Bhuvan passes his century, while most of the later wickets fall. Ismail returns to bat with the help of a runner and passes his half-century, reducing the required runs to an attainable total. The game comes down to the last over with Kachra on strike. With one ball remaining and the team down five runs, Kachra knocks the ball a short distance, managing a single. However, the umpire signals no ball. Bhuvan returns to bat and swings extremely hard at the next ball. Captain Russell backpedals and catches it, gleefully believing that the British team has won until he realises that he has caught gone beyond the boundary which gives six runs, and the win, to Bhuvan''s team. Even as they celebrate the victory, the drought ends as a rainstorm erupts.\r\nBhuvan''s defeat of the British team leads to the disbanding of the humiliated cantonment. In addition, Russell is forced to pay the taxes for the whole province and is transferred to Central Africa. After realising that Bhuvan loves Gauri, Elizabeth returns to London. Heartbroken, she remains unmarried for the rest of her life. The narrator (Amitabh Bachchan) says that Bhuvan went on to marry Gauri with great pomp and show. He concludes by saying that, despite the historic triumph, Bhuvan''s name was lost in the pages of history.\r\n'),

Johnny Fontane, a famous singer and godson to Vito, seeks his help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to Los Angeles to talk the obnoxious studio head, Jack Woltz, into giving Johnny the part. Woltz is unmoved until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion.\r\nShortly before Christmas 1945, drug baron Virgil "The Turk" Sollozzo, backed by the Tattaglia crime family, asks Don Corleone for both investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines. Suspicious, he sends his enforcer,Luca Brasi, to spy on them. Sollozzo has Vito gunned down in the street, then kidnaps Hagen. With Corleone first-born Sonny in command, Hagen is pressured to persuade him to accept Sollozzo''s deal, then released. Vito survives, and at the hospital Michael thwarts another attempt on his father; Michael''s jaw is broken by NYPD Captain Marc McCluskey, Sollozzo''s bodyguard.

He and Kay reunite and marry the next year.\r\nWith his father at the end of his career and his brother too weak, Michael takes the reins of the family, promising his wife the business will be legitimate within five years. To that end, he insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Tom is not a "wartime consigliere"; the older man agrees Tom should "have no part in what will happen" in the coming battles with rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene''s stake in the family''s casinos, their partner derides the Corleones for being run out of New York; Michael is dismayed to see that Fredo has fallen under Greene''s sway.\r\nVito suffers a fatal heart attack. At his funeral, Tessio, a Corleone capo, asks Michael to meet with Don Barzini, signalling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned.

Through the diary, she learns about the story of five freedom fighters who were active in the movement: Chandrasekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh, Shivaram Rajguru,Ashfaqulla Khan, and Ram Prasad Bismil. McKinley, in his diary, states that he had met two type of people in his life: the first one... who died without uttering a sound and the second kind ... who died with lots of anguish.. crying over their deaths... McKinley reveals that it was then that he met with the third kind....\r\nHaving decided to make a self-financed documentary film about these revolutionaries, Sue travels to India, with the help of her friend, Sonia (Soha Ali Khan), from the Institute for International Studies at the University of Delhi. After a few unsuccessful auditions in search of the actors, Sue finally casts Sonia''s friends, four young men  Daljit "DJ" (Aamir Khan), Karan Singhania (Siddharth Narayan), Aslam Khan (Kunal Kapoor) and Sukhi Ram (Sharman Joshi)  to portray the revolutionaries.\r\nThough they aren''t very enthusiastic at the idea of acting in a film about the independence movement, Sue eventually manages to convince them. Laxman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni), a political party activist, joins the cast later, despite initially being unpopular due to his anti-Western ideology, due to which he is often at odds with the other four, and anti-Muslim beliefs and contempt for Aslam Khan. In the process of filming, the idealism of India''s revolutionary heroes seeps into the protagonists. They gradually begin to realize that their own lives are quite similar to the characters they portray in Sue''s film and that the state of affairs that once plagued the revolutionaries continues to torment their generation.\r\nMeanwhile, Ajay Singh Rathod (R. Madhavan), a flight lieutenant in the Indian Air Force who is Sonia''s fiance, is killed when his jet, a MiG-21, crashes. The government proclaims that the crash was caused by pilot error and closes the investigation. Knowing that Rathod was an ace pilot, Sonia and her friends do not accept the official explanation. Instead, they claim that he sacrificed his life to save hundreds of other lives that would have been lost had he ejected from the aircraft and left it to crash into a populous city. They investigate and learn that the crash was due to a corrupt defence minister (Mohan Agashe), who had signed a contract exchanging cheap and illegal MiG-21 aircraft spare parts for a personal favour. To their surprise, they learn that the key person who was responsible for organizing the deal was Karan''s father, Rajnath Singhania (Anupam Kher).\r\nAngered by the situation, the group and their supporters decide to protest peacefully at India Gate, a war memorial in New Delhi. Police forcefully break up their protest using batons; in the process, Rathod''s mother (Waheeda Rehman) is severely hurt and she slips into a coma. DJ, Karan, Aslam, Sukhi, and Laxman decide that they must emulate the early freedom fighters and resort to violence to achieve justice. As a result, they kill the defence minister to avenge Rathod''s death, while Karan murders his father for his corrupt actions. The minister is reported to have been killed by terrorists and is hailed as a martyr by the media. To bring forth their intentions behind the killings, the five of them attempt to reach the public through a radio station. They forcibly take over the All India Radio station premises after having evacuated its employees. Karan goes on air and reveals the truth about the defence minister and his wrongdoings. While still on the air, the police proclaim that they are dangerous terrorists who have forcefully taken over the AIR, and therefore they are to be shot on sight.

When Karan understands that he has been shot, they speak amongst themselves for the last time, regarding the others, about Sue and about Daljit''s love for her. It is there that they are shot to death, but not without the sound of their hearty laughter still hanging in the air like an echo of long dead music. It is then revealed that McKinley described the third kind of people he came across as being the ones who embraced death as a friend and an equal, with a heartfelt laughter. After their death, the public reacts with outrage and expresses urge to bring Indian Politics to justice, following the motives of all the boys.\r\nThe film comes to an end with Sue describing the impact of the boys on her life.

Their latest target, Japanese businessman Saito (Ken Watanabe), reveals that he arranged their mission himself to test Cobb for a seemingly-impossible job: planting an idea in a person''s subconscious, or "inception".\r\nTo break up the energy conglomerate of ailing competitor Maurice Fischer (Pete Postlethwaite), Saito wants Cobb to convince Fischer''s son and heir, Robert (Cillian Murphy), to dissolve his father''s company. In return, Saito promises to use his influence to clear Cobb of a murder charge, allowing Cobb to return home to his children. Cobb accepts the offer and assembles his team: Eames (Tom Hardy), a conman and identity forger; Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a chemist who concocts a powerful sedative for a stable "dream within a dream" strategy, Ariadne (Ellen Page), an architecture student tasked with designing the labyrinth of the dream landscapes, recruited with the help of Cobb''s father-in-law, Professor Stephen Miles (Michael Caine). While dream-sharing with Cobb, Ariadne learns his subconscious houses an invasive projection of his late wife Mal (Marion Cotillard).\r\nWhen the elder Fischer dies in Sydney, Robert Fischer accompanies the body on a ten-hour flight back to Los Angeles, which the team (including Saito, who wants to verify their success) uses as an opportunity to sedate and take Fischer into a shared dream. At each dream level, the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a "kick" that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members from the deeper dream level. The plan is for Yusuf to drive off a bridge in the first level, Arthur to use the elevator in the second level, and Eames to create an explosion in the third level simultaneously.\r\nThe first level is Yusuf''s dream of a rainy Los Angeles. The team abducts Fischer, but they are attacked by armed projections from Fischer''s subconscious, which has been trained to defend against extraction. The team takes Fischer and a wounded Saito to a warehouse, where Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally wake Saito up, the powerful sedatives needed to stabilize the multi-level dream will instead send a dying dreamer into "limbo", a world of infinite subconscious from which it is very difficult to escape. Despite these setbacks, the team continues with the mission.\r\nEames impersonates Fischer''s godfather, Peter Browning (Tom Berenger), to suggest Fischer reconsider his father''s will. Yusuf drives the van as the other dreamers are sedated into the second level.\r\nIn the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur, Cobb convinces Fischer that he has been kidnapped by Browning and Cobb is his subconscious protector. Cobb persuades him to go down another level to explore Browning''s subconscious (in reality, it is a ruse to enter Fischer''s).\r\nThe third level is a snowy mountain fortress dreamed by Eames. The team has to infiltrate it and hold off the guards as Cobb takes Fischer into the equivalent of his subconscious.\r\nYusuf, under pursuit by Fischer''s projections in the first level, deliberately drives off a bridge and initiates his kick too soon. This removes the gravity of Arthur''s level, forcing him to improvise a new kick that will synchronize with the van hitting the water, and causes an avalanche in Eames'' level. The Mal projection kills Fischer, Cobb kills Mal, and Saito succumbs to his wounds; all three fall into Limbo. While Eames sets up a kick by rigging the fortress with explosives, Cobb and Ariadne enter limbo to rescue Fischer and Saito.\r\nCobb reveals to Ariadne that he and Mal went to limbo while experimenting with the dream-sharing technology. There, they spent fifty years constructing a world from their shared memories. When Mal refused to return to reality, Cobb used a rudimentary form of inception by compromising her totem (an object dreamers use to distinguish dreams from reality) and implanted in her mind the idea that the world was not real. However, when she woke up, Mal was still convinced that she was dreaming. In an attempt to "wake up" for real, Mal committed suicide and framed Cobb for her death to force him to do the same. Facing a murder charge, Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children in the care of Professor Miles.\r\nThrough his confession, Cobb makes peace with his guilt over Mal''s death. Ariadne kills the Mal projection and wakes Fischer up with a kick. Revived at the mountain fortress, Fischer enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: a projection of his dying father telling him to be his own man. While Cobb remains in Limbo to search for Saito, the other team members ride the synchronized kicks back to reality: Ariadne jumps off a balcony, Eames detonates the explosives in the fortress, Arthur blasts an elevator containing the team''s sleeping bodies up the shaft, and the van hits the water. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in Limbo, reminding him of their agreement. The dreamers all awaken on the plane and Saito makes a phone call.\r\nUpon arrival at Los Angeles Airport, Cobb passes the U.S. immigration checkpoint and Professor Miles accompanies him to his home. Cobb spins his spinning top to verify he is not still dreaming, but leaves it spinning on the table to join his children in the garden.\r\n'),

Rothschild, employed under Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey), who quickly entices him to the addictive tendencies of stockbroker culture, as well as fostering a mentality around absolute self-profit. Jordan soon finds his career terminated following Black Monday. He takes a job at a boiler room brokerage firm on Long Island that specializes in penny stocks. Thanks to his aggressive pitching style and the high commissions, Jordan makes a small fortune.\r\nJordan befriends his apartment neighbor Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), and the two found their own company. They recruit Jordan''s accountant parents as well as several of Jordan''s friends, whom Jordan trains in the art of the "hard sell". The basic method of the firm is a pump and dump scam. To cloak this, Jordan gives the firm the respectable name of "Stratton Oakmont". After an expose in Forbes, hundreds of ambitious young financiers flock to his company.\r\nJordan becomes immensely successful, he slides into a decadent lifestyle of prostitutes and drugs. He has an affair with a woman named Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie). When his wife Teresa (Cristin Milioti) finds out, they divorce and he marries Naomi, soon having a daughter, Skylar. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and theFBI begin investigating Stratton Oakmont.\r\nJordan illegally makes $22 million in three hours upon securing the IPO of Steve Madden (Jake Hoffman). This brings him and his firm to the attention of the FBI, mainly agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler). To hide his illegitimate money, Jordan opens a Swiss bank account with corrupt banker Jean-Jacques Saurel (Jean Dujardin) in the name of Naomi''s aunt Emma (Joanna Lumley), who is a British citizen and thus outside the reach of American authorities. He uses the wife and in-laws of his friend Brad Bodnick (Jon Bernthal), who have European passports, to smuggle the cash into Switzerland.\r\nDonnie gets into a public fight with Brad, and while Donnie escapes, Brad is arrested. Jordan also learns from his private investigator that the FBI is wiretapping his phones. Fearing for his son, Jordan''s father (Rob Reiner) pressures him to leave Stratton Oakmont and lie low while Jordan''s lawyer (Jon Favreau) orchestrates a deal to keep him out of prison. Jordan, however, cannot bear to quit, and talks himself into staying in the middle of his farewell speech.\r\nJordan, Donnie and their wives are on a yacht trip to Italy when they learn that Aunt Emma has died of a heart attack. Over the objections of his grieving wife and his yacht captain, Jordan decides to sail to Monaco so they can drive to Switzerland without getting their passports stamped at the border and settle the bank account, but a violent storm capsizes their yacht. After their rescue by Italian Coast Guard, the plane sent to take them to Geneva is destroyed when a seagull flies into the engine. Jordan considers this a sign from God and decides to sober up.\r\nTwo years later, the FBI arrests Jordan because Saurel, while being arrested in Florida on an unrelated charge, has told the FBI about Jordan''s criminal activities. Since the evidence against him is overwhelming, Jordan agrees to gather evidence on his colleagues in exchange for leniency.\r\nFed up with Jordan''s lifestyle, Naomi tells Jordan she is divorcing him and wants full custody of their children. After their argument turns violent, Jordan relapses on cocaine and attempts to kidnap their daughter Skylar before crashing his car into a fence. Naomi and Jordan''s housekeeper rescue Skylar from the vehicle and leave Jordan, bleeding and defeated, in the car.\r\nThe next morning, Jordan wears a wire to work. Jordan slips Donnie a note warning him about the wire. The FBI discovers the note, and Jordan is arrested for breaching his cooperation deal. The FBI raids and shuts down Stratton Oakmont.\r\nDespite this one breach, Jordan receives a reduced sentence for his testimony and is sentenced to 36 months in a minimum security prison in Nevada. After his 2006 release, Jordan makes a living hosting seminars on sales technique.\r\n\r\n'),
(19, 'Interstellar', '"dummy/thumb-19.jpg"', 'Sci-Fi', 'Hollywood', ' Christopher Nolan', 'Later in the 21st century, crop blight on Earth has made farming increasingly difficult and threatens humanity''s survival. Cooper, a widowed former NASA pilot, runs a farm with his father-in-law, son, and daughter Murphy, who believes her bedroom is haunted by a poltergeist. When a pattern is created out of dust on the floor, Cooper realizes there is no "ghost", only someone trying to communicate using gravity. He interprets the pattern as a message formed into binary code, which when translated provides a set of geographic coordinates, which Cooper and Murphy follow to a secret NASA facility. There, they are met by Dr. Brand, Cooper''s former professor.\r\nBrand reveals that a wormhole, apparently created by a higher intelligence, appeared near Saturn 48 years before, leading to a distant galaxy, with numerous potentially habitable planets. Twelve volunteers have gone through it, knowing they may never be able to return, each to assess a planet''s suitability as humanity''s new home. Miller, Edmunds and Mann have sent encouraging data from planets near Gargantua, a black hole. Brand recruits Cooper to pilot the spaceship Endurance to evaluate as many of the planets as possible, while he works on "Plan A", a theory to harness gravity for propulsion, which would allow humanity to leave Earth. The Endurance also carries 5,000 frozenembryos as "Plan B", to provide for humanity''s survival. Cooper agrees to go, upsetting Murphy.\r\nCooper''s crew consists of scientists Romilly, Doyle, Brand''s daughter Amelia, and robots TARS and CASE. Traversing the wormhole, they head to Miller''s planet, an ocean world where time is severely dilated due to its proximity to Gargantua; for each hour there, seven years pass on Earth. While Romilly and TARS remain aboard, the rest descend to the surface, where they find only the wreckage from Miller''s expedition. Amelia retrieves Miller''s data just before a gigantic tidal wave hits, killing Doyle, and water-logging the engines, preventing a timely departure. When Cooper, Amelia, and CASE manage to return to Endurance, 23 years have elapsed on Earth.\r\nOn Earth, Murphy, now an adult, has been assisting Dr. Brand with his research. On his deathbed, he admits to her that the gravity equation is unsolvable and Plan A impossible, and that he lied to everyone, pinning his hopes on Plan B. Murphy notifies Amelia of her father''s death, then accuses her and Cooper of abandoning Earth. She continues working, believing the equations can be solved if she could somehow get more data on gravitational singularities.\r\nWith limited fuel, the crew decide to go to Mann''s planet, rather than Edmunds'', as Mann is still transmitting. Mann assures the crew that while the frozen planet has an ammonia-laden atmosphere, the surface is livable. Once they are alone, however, Mann attempts to kill Cooper, revealing that he falsified the data to be rescued. He then takes Cooper''s ranger and heads for Endurance. Meanwhile, Romilly is killed by a booby trap Mann had set.\r\nAfter Amelia rescues Cooper, they race to Endurance in the second lander, where Mann is attempting to dock despite being locked out of the autodocking system. Mann ignores Cooper''s plea not to open the airlock, which fails catastrophically. Mann is killed and the severely damaged Endurance begins falling out of orbit. Cooper uses the lander to stabilize the ship.\r\nAfter the rescue TARS warns Cooper that Endurance is slipping toward Gargantua''s pull. Cooper makes a quick decision to use Gargantua as a gravitational slingshot to propel them toward Edmunds'' planet, but their proximity to the black hole means 51 years will elapse on Earth. To shed weight, Cooper jettisons himself and TARS towards the black hole, so that Amelia and CASE can complete the journey. Cooper and TARS slip past the event horizon, and find themselves enveloped inside a tesseract, which appears as a stream of bookshelves that look into Murphy''s bedroom at different periods in her life. Cooper surmises that the tesseract and wormhole were created by five-dimensional beings to enable him to communicate with Murphy and soon deduces that he was her "ghost" all along. He relays the quantum data that TARS collected from Gargantua''s singularity by manipulating the second hand of a watch he gave to Murphy before he left, which enables Murphy to solve the gravitational equation.\r\nCooper is ejected into normal space and awakens in a space habitat orbiting Saturn. He reunites with an aged Murphy, now near death. At Murphy''s urging, Cooper and TARS leave to rejoin Amelia on Edmunds'' habitable planet, where she and CASE have begun to set up a colony using Plan B.\r\n'),

Bean wins the first prize in a raffle  a holiday involving a train journey to Cannes, a video camera, and Euro 200.\r\nFollowing a misunderstanding involving a taxi at the Gare du Nord railway station in Paris, Bean is forced to make his way unorthodoxly towards the Gare de Lyon to board his next train towards Cannes. However, a vending machine prevents him from boarding, and he misses his train, giving him an hour to sample French seafood cuisine.\r\nBack on the platform, Bean asks Russian movie director Emil Duchevsky (Karel Roden) to use his camcorder to film him walking onto the train. Bean makes a big fuss and keeps asking for retakes, so by the time they are done, the train is about to leave. Although Bean manages to get onto the train, the doors close before Duchevsky can get on. Duchevsky''s son, Stepan (Max Baldry) is therefore left on board by himself.\r\nBean attempts to befriend the boy, who has been told to get off at the next station, and eventually comes to his rescue at the station, unfortunately missing his train again. The train Stepan''s father has boarded does not stop at the station, and a mobile number is held up, with the last two digits obscured. Attempts at calling the number prove fruitless. The next train comes and they board. However, Bean has left his wallet, passport and ticket on the telephone box and they are thrown off the train.\r\nAttempts at begging and miming to Puccini''s "O mio babbino caro" prove successful, and Bean buys the pair a bus ticket to Cannes. Bean managed to lose his, though, and attempts to hitchhike his way there. Mr Bean soon falls asleep, exhausted from walking and wakes up on what appears to be a quaint French village but is actually a film set. Bean ends up as an extra in the shooting, directed by Carson Clay (Willem Dafoe), but inadvertently ends up destroying the set in an explosion when he charges his camera.\r\nBean then tries to hitchhike again and a lime-green Mini identical to his picks him up, driven by Sabine, who offers him a lift to Cannes. She is an aspiring actress on her way to the 59th Cannes Film Festival where the film that Clay directed is going to be presented with her scene. When they stop at a service station, Bean finds Stepan dancing in a cafe with a band and they head on.\r\nSabine assumes Stepan is Bean''s son, while Stepan thinks Sabine is Bean''s girlfriend. On the road, Bean and Stepan use Sabine''s phone to call his father again, but to no avail, and the trio end up driving through the night, arriving in Cannes the next morning.\r\nAt a petrol station, Sabine sees Mr. Bean''s photo on TV as a suspect of kidnapping Stepan and Sabine as Bean''s accomplice. However, since she does not want to miss the film in Cannes in just one hour, she does not want to go to the police now to clear the misunderstandings. Therefore, they have to work out a way to get into Cannes without being identified. Stepan dresses up as a girl while Mr. Bean dresses up as Stepan''s grandmother. The ploy works and Sabine arrives on time.\r\nAfter sneaking into the premiere, many of the viewers find Clay''s film terribly boring and Bean is disappointed to see that Sabine''s role has been cut from the film. He plugs his video camera into the projector, projecting his video diary. The bizarre tale it tells fits director Carson Clay''s narration well, and the director, Sabine and Bean all receive standing ovations and Stepan is finally reunited with his father.\r\nAfter the screening, Bean leaves the building by the back door, and onto the beach, encountering many of the characters from the film. The film then ends with Bean and all the other characters of the film miming a large finale to the music of Charles Trenet''s song "La Mer", with arms raised in the air. Just before the credits Bean writes fin in the sand with his foot.\r\n'),
